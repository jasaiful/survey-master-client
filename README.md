## Challenges Faced:

During the development of SurveyMaster Pro, several challenges were encountered, including:

1. **Third-Party Integration Issues:**
   Integrating the payment system and ensuring seamless functionality within the app might face hurdles due to changes in API endpoints or data formats from the payment gateway provider.

2. **Security Vulnerabilities:**
   Handling user authentication and ensuring secure transmission of sensitive data (like payment information) requires rigorous security measures to prevent potential threats like data breaches or unauthorized access.

3. **Scaling Problems:**
   As the user base grows, managing the increased load on the server, especially during peak times when surveys receive high traffic, could pose scalability challenges that require optimizing server configurations and database queries.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   Displaying survey results visually with charts and graphs in real-time, especially handling these operations on the backend and presenting them to users without compromising performance, might require fine-tuning algorithms and caching strategies.

5. **Deadline Management:**
   Managing deadlines and project milestones while ensuring the quality of deliverables can be challenging, especially when unforeseen issues arise.
